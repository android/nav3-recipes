# Navigation 3 - Code recipes
[Jetpack Navigation 3](https://goo.gle/nav3) is a library for app navigation. This repository contains recipes for how to 
use its APIs to implement common navigation use cases.

## Recipes
These are the recipes and what they demonstrate. 

### Basic API examples
- **[Basic](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/basic)**: Shows most basic API usage.
- **[Saveable back stack](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/basicsaveable)**: As above, with a persistent back stack.
- **[Entry provider DSL](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/basicdsl)**: As above, using the entryProvider DSL.

### Layouts and animations
- **[Dialog](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/dialog)**: Shows how to create a Dialog destination.
- **[Custom Scene](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/scenes/twopane)**: Shows how to create a custom layout using a `Scene` and `SceneStrategy` (see video of UI behavior below).
- **[Animations](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/animations)**: Override the default animations for all destinations and a single destination.

### Material adaptive layouts
Examples showing how to use the layouts provided by the [Compose Material3 Adaptive Navigation3 library](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-material3-adaptive#compose_material3_adaptive_navigation3_version_10_2)
- **[List-Detail](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/material/listdetail)**: Shows how to use a Material adaptive list-detail layout.
- **[Supporting Pane](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/material/supportingpane)**: Shows how to use a Material adaptive supporting pane layout.

### Common use cases
- **[Common navigation UI](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/commonui)**: A common navigation toolbar where each item in the toolbar navigates to a top level destination.
- **[Conditional navigation](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/conditional)**: Switch to a different navigation flow when a condition is met. For example, for authentication or first-time user onboarding.

### Architecture
- **[Modularized navigation code](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/modular/hilt)**: Demonstrates how to decouple navigation code into separate modules (uses Dagger/Hilt for DI). 

### Passing navigation arguments to ViewModels
- **[Basic ViewModel](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/passingarguments/viewmodels/basic)**: Navigation arguments are passed to a ViewModel constructed using `viewModel()`
- **[Hilt injected ViewModel](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/passingarguments/viewmodels/hilt)**: Navigation arguments are passed to a ViewModel constructed using `hiltViewModel()`
- **[Koin injected ViewModel](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/passingarguments/viewmodels/koin)**: Navigation arguments are passed to a ViewModel constructed using `koinViewModel()`

### Planned
- **Deeplinks**: Create and handle deeplinks to specific destinations
- **Android XR**: Custom navigation and layout behavior for Android XR
- **Returning a result from a destination**: Return a result to a previous destination

## Custom layout example
The following is a screen recording showing the navigation behavior of a [custom, two-pane Scene](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/scenes/twopane).

## Instructions
Clone this repository and open the root folder in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). Each recipe is contained in its own package with its own `Activity`.
